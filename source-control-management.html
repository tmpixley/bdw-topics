	<p>A source control management system (SCM) is software that provides coordination and services between members of a software development team,provides file management and version control so that team members don’t write over each other’s changes, and gives developers the ability to work concurrently on files.</p>
	
	<p>In the article <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/120802/Source_Code_Management_Systems_Trends_Analysis_and_Best_Features">Source Code Management Systems: Trends, Analysis and Best Features</a> by Janel Garvin, different SCMs are discussed, and the pros and cons of each explored.
