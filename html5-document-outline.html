<p class="p1">While searching for posts on the topic of HTML5 document outlines I struggled to find any long enough for me to possibly write more than a few paragraphs about. In fact, most consisted of less than a paragraph of actual writing followed by a sample outline or string of example code. Then I happened upon Luke Stevens' article <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/html5/truth-about-structuring-html5-page-9122842"><span class="s1">The truth about structuring an HTML5 page</span></a> on the Creative Bloq site.</p>
<p class="p1">Wow, does Luke Stevens have some passionate things to say about HTML5. He hates it. In fact, he has so much to say about it that he wrote an entire book on the subject titled <a href="http://www.truthabouthtml5.com/"><span class="s1">The Truth About HTML5</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">He thinks that HTML5 document outlining is confusing for web developers, that it doesn't work properly with all versions of browsers, and that it is actually worse for screen readers. He recommends using WAI-ARIA instead, which he says already works with screen readers and works on all versions of browsers.</p>
<p class="p1">After reading the article I decided that I might get more out of an article that was a proponent of html5 document outlining. So I read an article recommended by another BDW student, <a href="http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/16/html5-and-the-document-outlining-algorithm/"><span class="s1">HTML5 and the Document Outlining Algorithm</span></a> by Derek Johnson on Smashing Magazine.</p>
<p class="p1">While Johnson's article was very informative, I have to admit, it was also incredibly dull. Steven's post may qualify as more of a rant than as an informational article, but at least he was passionate and interesting to read. And he did do his homework, for every claim that he made he sited multiple sources with links.</p>
<p class="p1">I don't know enough about HTML5 yet to make an informed decision about whether I should use an HTML5 document outline or ARIA. Rather than making a decision based on these two articles, I will instead defer to the judgement of Richard Jones, my front end development instructor at BDW.</p>
