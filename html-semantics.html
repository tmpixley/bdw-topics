	<title> On HTML5 Semantics </title>

<body>

<p>Although the article <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/semanticsinhtml5">Semantics in HTML 5</a> posted in A List Apart by John Allsopp was written in 2009, the questions that he brings up about the future of html seem still relevant today.</p>

<p>I must also note that it was a relief to find such a fun, refreshing writer on the topic.  Not everyone can write about a topic like this and manage to make it in any way pleasurable.  In fact, I attempted to read other posts on this and similar topics and found this to be the most interesting and well written so far.</p>

<p>In the article, Allsopp writes about his concern that HTML 5 doesn't improve the ability of developers to add rich and meaningful semantics to their markup.</p>

<p>"We don&apos;t need to add specific terms to the vocabulary of HTML," he writes,  "we need to add a mechanism that allows semantic richness to be added to a document as required."</p> 

<p>Allsopp questions why html 5 doesn't use an existing vocabulary, like that of Docbook.</p>

<p>He also recommends that HTML 5 adopt a number of new attributes instead of new elements.  Allsopp ends with a list of questions for the community at large to address regarding the solution to the problems that he has just documented.</p>

<p>Since this article was written so long ago, I'm not sure where html 5 stands today in terms of semantics.  Have Allsopp's questions been answered?   I am curious to learn more about html 5 and find out the answers to his questions, as well as how to actually use html 5 for my own purposes.</p>
