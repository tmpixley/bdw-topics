<h1>Understanding Float Collapse</h1>
<p> Since I'm fairly new to front end development I was grateful to find this detailed article on <a href="http://designshack.net/articles/css/everything-you-never-knew-about-css-floats/">Everything You Never Knew About CSS Floats</a>.  The author starts by detailing what floats are and how they work on a basic level.  He explains how setting an element to float affects the bordering boxes of the elements involved, and what to do in order to get margins to work properly.  .</p>

<p>He covers the basic rules that govern the position of a floated element and how floated elements of varying heights will be positioned as well as how right floated items appear in reverse order. Finally, he talks about how a parent containing only floated children will have a collapsed height and how you can solve it. </p>
