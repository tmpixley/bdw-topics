	<p>Like the name implies, a pseudo element is not considered an element by html. It's a feature in CSS that lets us add extra markup without disrupting the actual document.</p>
	
	<p>The neatest article that I found is <a href="http://http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-element-roundup/">A Whole Bunch of Amazing Stuff Pseudo Elements Can Do</a> by Chris Coyier.  He shows how you can use pseudo elements for multiple background canvases, make shapes, show url's in printed web pages, clear floats, simulate float: center, label blocks of code, create icon sets, organize space more efficiently, apply typographic flourishes, and a whole lot more. </p>
