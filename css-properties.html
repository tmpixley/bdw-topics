<h1>CSS Properties</h1>
<p>The CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element. It can also place an element behind another, and specify what should happen when an element's content is too big. These can be found at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp/">CSS Positioning</a>.</p>

<p>There are four different positioning methods, status, fixed, relative and absolute. </p>
